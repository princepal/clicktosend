# OTP Email Verification Implementation

This document describes the OTP (One-Time Password) email verification system implemented for user registration.

## Overview

The OTP system adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to verify their email address with a 6-digit code before they can access the application.

## Database Changes

### New Columns Added to Users Table

- `otp` (string, 6 characters, nullable): Stores the generated OTP
- `verified` (boolean, default: false): Indicates if the user has verified their email

### Migration

The migration `2025_07_07_054011_add_otp_and_verified_to_users_table.php` adds these columns to the existing users table.

## Implementation Details

### 1. User Registration Flow

1. User fills out registration form
2. System creates user with `verified = false` and generates a 6-digit OTP
3. OTP is sent to user's email address
4. User is redirected to OTP verification page
5. User enters OTP
6. If OTP is correct, user is marked as verified and logged in
7. If OTP is incorrect, error message is shown

### 2. Login Flow

1. User attempts to login with email/password
2. If credentials are correct but user is not verified:
   - New OTP is generated and sent
   - User is redirected to OTP verification page
3. If user is verified, normal login proceeds

### 3. Google OAuth Flow

- Google OAuth users are automatically marked as verified since Google already verifies their email

## Files Modified/Created

### Controllers

- `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/RegisteredUserController.php` - Modified to send OTP instead of direct login
- `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/OtpController.php` - New controller for OTP verification
- `app/Http/Controllers/Auth/GoogleController.php` - Updated to set verified status for Google users

### Models

- `app/Models/User.php` - Added `otp` and `verified` to fillable array and casts

### Views

- `resources/views/auth/otp.blade.php` - New OTP verification page
- `resources/views/emails/otp.blade.php` - Email template for OTP

### Routes

- `routes/auth.php` - Added OTP routes:
  - `GET /otp` - Show OTP verification form
  - `POST /otp/verify` - Verify OTP
  - `POST /otp/resend` - Resend OTP

### Request Classes

- `app/Http/Requests/Auth/LoginRequest.php` - Modified to check verification status

## Email Configuration

The system uses Laravel's mail configuration. By default, emails are logged to `storage/logs/laravel.log` for development.

To configure actual email sending, update the mail configuration in `config/mail.php` and set up your SMTP credentials in the `.env` file.

## Testing

### Test Command

Use the provided test command to verify OTP functionality:

```bash
php artisan test:otp user@example.com
```

This will:
1. Find the user with the specified email
2. Generate a new OTP
3. Send the OTP email
4. Display the OTP in the console for testing

### Manual Testing

1. Register a new user
2. Check the email or logs for the OTP
3. Enter the OTP on the verification page
4. Verify that the user is logged in and marked as verified

## Security Features

- OTP is 6 digits long
- OTP is cleared after successful verification
- Rate limiting is applied to login attempts
- Unverified users cannot access the application
- OTP emails include security warnings

## Future Enhancements

- OTP expiration time
- SMS OTP option
- Backup codes for account recovery
- OTP attempt limiting
- Email template customization
